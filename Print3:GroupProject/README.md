Group Project
==============
Leone Ermer, Katie Miles, Richelle Vargas

Our approach to the project was to connect found objects through attachments made with 3D printed PLA.
Each one of us brought an object (two of which are kitchen utensils) to the table and we all brainstormed
ways in which we could connect them together. This evolved into the concept of an “awkward drawing machine”.
There would be a pencil connected to the can opener’s gears, and the apple slicer would be connected to the
can opener’s handle that turns the gears. So, by turning the apple slicer (like you would a steering wheel) 
the gears would turn the pencil.

We decided to increase the distance between the can opener and the apple slicer with full sized dowels. In doing
so, the piece’s practicality decreased and it became more of an art piece rather than a functional object. By 
adding the dowels, the piece became difficult to handle by a single person. It now lends itself to being explored by two people. The experience of one person holding the handle of the can opener and another twisting the apple slicer is interesting because both are trying to figure out how they can manipulate their respective object as well as how they can work together with the other person.

We did run into some problems (two of the attachments don’t stay on securely), however this sparked ideas for future projects, and ways of attaching.
