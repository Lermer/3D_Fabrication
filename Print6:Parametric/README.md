Print 6: Parametric
==============

For my Parametric print I designed a parametric box with adjustable width, length, depth and wall thinkness
controls as well as dividers that can be removed or shifted and an optional lid.

For my first version I made a basic box with three sections and a lid.
For the second iteration I made a pencil box with a lid that can hold about 4 pencils and a eraser.
For the third iteration I made a brush holder with 4 sections.

My Parametric Boxe's Controls are as follows

//Box Controls

boxWidth = // Y axis
boxLength = // X axis
boxDepth = // Z axis
boxThickness = // controls box thickness and lid thickness

// Box Divider Controls

dividerThickness = boxThickness;
yDivider = true; // Adds or removes divider that runs along y axis
xDivider = true; // Adds or removes divider that runs along x axis
fourSections = false; // true = 4 sections / false = 3 sections
yDividerPos = /Controls Divider position
xDividerPos = /Controls Divider positions 

// Lid Controls
lid = true; //True for a lid, False for no lid
