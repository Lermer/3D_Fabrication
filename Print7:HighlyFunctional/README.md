Print 7: Highly Functional
==============

For my Highly Functional 3D print, I have designed a faucet drinking fountain. The tool consists of
two 3D printed pieces, a faucet attachment piece and the actual fountain piece. The faucet attachment
will be printed with an infill with Thermochromic PLA, while the fountain piece will be printed win no infill
with Soft PLA. Both parts are on the same OpenSCAD file and can be toggled on and off.
